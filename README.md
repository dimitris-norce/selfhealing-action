# selfhealing-action
Demo experimental repository of a self-healing code GitHub action pipeline using [Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [Openai](https://openai.com/).

The workflow action is language agnostic and works on single file errors only for now.

Based on [this repo](https://github.com/xpluscal/selfhealing-action-express) but modified slightly to use AzureAI instead.

## What is this?
The repository is a simple express typescript server with a github workflow action that triggers the healing process when the build action fails.

## How does it work?

The workflow action is triggered when a pull request is made to the repository. The action runs the build script and if it fails, it triggers the healing process. The healing process runs an LLM chain to determine:

1. Where the error is
2. What the error is
3. What the fix is
4. Writes the fix to the file

Then it commits the changes back to the repository.

## Where could this go from here?
This should be treated as an early experimental prototype and currently works on single files only. The next steps could be to:

<!-- checkmark -->
- [ ] Create embeddings of dependencies and use them to determine the correct file to fix (e.g. by passing the relevant context via Vector Similarity Search from a vector DB)
- [ ] Add support for multiple / recursive file detections and errors
- [ ] Add support for retry limits to avoid the infinite loop when no fixes can be found
- [ ] Change workflow to instead of commiting to the branch directly, have the AI commit to a new branch and then create a pull request and assign to the original committer for review
- [ ] Add better test support
